Created a cafeteria simulation program for a mathematics student using SimPy Python. The program analyzes cafeteria efficiency, including customer count and queue time, by incorporating parallel processing for a more accurate representation of daily scenarios. This project offers insights into cafeteria operational dynamics and service efficiency.
